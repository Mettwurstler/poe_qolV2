Hello :)

I tried to update the already existing app from the main creator: https://github.com/notablackbear/poe_qolV2.
The POE_QOL_V3.exe is the standalone app.
I tried to explain everything directly in the app. Just start the POE_QOL_V3.exe, write your settings and press "Overlay" to start using the app for chaos recipe.
After open the Overlay you can also search with the item buttons for special itemgroups to sort your loot tab faster. The new poe update will do it automatically, but for those who dont have much tabs or for special items like 6 links, veiled, jewels, ... the sorting function is still useful.
