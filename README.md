Hello :)

I tried to update the already existing app from the main creator: https://github.com/notablackbear/poe_qolV2.
The POE_QOL_V3.exe is the standalone app.
I tried to explain everything directly in the app. Just start the POE_QOL_V3.exe, write your settings and press "Overlay" to start using the app for chaos recipe.
